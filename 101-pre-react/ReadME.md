## React With Plain JS

For Running React we need three code Library

1. React Code Library 
2. React DOM
3. Babel for parsing jsx code into JavaScript code

### In React Environment we need to have 

* combining multiple files -- webpack, parcel
* processing next generation JS(JSX) -- babel (for parsing JSX)
* check code quality -- eslint

and so on....

**all these things to have reactive environment easy to make for us is create-react-app**

` npx create-react-app myapp`
